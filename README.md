#KvBlink#

This is a simple app I made to begin learning Kivy.

It's still looking like a draft but it's fonctional although there's space for some improvement.

It's absolutely useless, but I enjoyed learning Kivy basics while creating it.

###Requirements###
You just need to install Kivy. Go to their website to know more about installation

http://kivy.org/

Just clone and you go in the folder just above the files and launch ```python kvblink``` or any name you gave the folder that contains the files. You can also launch the main.py ```python main.py```

###Principle###

Well, you see some randomly blinking tiles, just pres them to score points.
